Additional comments,"mouse looked like it was becoming emanciated and starting to have a hunched back, upon necropsy, there was a cranial nerve tumor somewhat attched to the base of the cranial cavity, and not as attached to the brain. A part of the tumor was fixed with the brain, while another part was frozen and used for a cell line.",,
