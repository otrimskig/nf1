Additional comments,"severly paralized to where it looks like it couldn't control bowel movements or urination, noticed on a Monday, but looked fine when it was last looked at on a Friday. Upon necropsy, brain looks normal, huge tumor around the base of the spinal cord, some of the tumor was frozen, used to make a cell line, and fixed.",,
