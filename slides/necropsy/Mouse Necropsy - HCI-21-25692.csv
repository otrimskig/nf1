Additional comments,"passed Friday health check, but found dead on Mon. After necropsy, a tumor was visable around right ear (T1) connected to the skull and separate from the skin. A second tumor is seen lower on the neck (T2) it is smaller. Tumors were fixed, brain was fixed too but mushy since this mouse was found dead.",,
