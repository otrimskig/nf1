Additional comments,"mouse is showing signs of partial paralysis on 4/7. Head is tilted to one side, but still able to move around. Could have gone longer, but no sense risking mouse dying on own. Necropsy showed bulge in left top of skull, under the left side of brain looked to be a glioma, attached a little to the base of the cranial cavity and partially attached to the brain, sort of mushy, cut some off to freeze and make cell line from as well as fixed the rest with the brain",,
