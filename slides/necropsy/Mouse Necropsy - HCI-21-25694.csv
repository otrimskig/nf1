Additional comments,"mouse was loosing mobility in hind legs and I didn't want to chance it over the weekend. I noticed a mass of tissue under the brain, not sure if it was an enlarged cranial nerve or that ""necrotic"" tissue Zia noticed before. Growing that tissue as a cell line, but too small for fixing it or freezing it as well",,
