Additional comments,"Head tumor was cut off, had vein on the outside but very dense and white on the inside. Skull underneith looked rough, but couldn't tell if tumor penetrated the skull or was growing from and eye or ear canal. Had to cut the skull to remove brain, and noticed a white mass on top of the left hemesphere. It wasn't connected to it, but was indenting the brain (might be able to see the indent on H&E), not clear if this penetrated the skull or not.",,
