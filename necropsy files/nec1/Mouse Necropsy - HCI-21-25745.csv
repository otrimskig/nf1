Additional comments,"only partially paralyzed, but looked very emanciated, so had to sack, small white spot on top center of skull (T1), not sure if that is anything, but fixed it anyway. Tumor was visible around the base of the spine, cross section of the spine was fixed (with bone), and piece of tumor was made into a cell line.",,
