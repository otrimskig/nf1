Additional comments,"mouse was small and a little emanciated or underdeveloped, and had a small tumor on head. Knowing what happens to older mice, as the tumor just gets bigger and it will be harder to remove brain, this mouse could have lived longer though, froze part of tumor, fixed part of tumor and made cell line from part of tumor, tumor first noticed within 5 days of 4/13, but exact date wasn't recorded",,
