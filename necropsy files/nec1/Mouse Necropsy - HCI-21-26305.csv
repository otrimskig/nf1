Additional comments,"mouse was hunched over, not moving much, and looked emanciated/sick, upon necropsy there was a large tumor under the brain that was not attached to the brain, but it was difficult to remove from the bottom of the cranial cavity, this is possibly growing from the left cranial nerve",,
