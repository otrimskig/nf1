Additional comments,"Head tumor did not appear to grow out from eye or ear, was separate from the skin, attached to the skull, no vasculature except on the periphery. Attached to the brain, but not by much is a small ball right at the front of it. That ball was preserved as well, but may or may not make it into the slides. Mouse was healthy in all aspects except for head tumor that was reaching 2cm. Brain and tumor were FFPE, part of tumor was also frozen and used to grow a cell line from.",,
