Additional comments,"tumor was just above left eye and was becoming red, as if it was ulcering or becoming irritated. Upon necropsy, tumor was observed to be connected to the skin and not the skull. It may be connected to the audible nerve as part of the tumor seamed to be very close to the ear and was fixed with part of the ear. A peice of tumor was frozen and also used for a cell line.",,
