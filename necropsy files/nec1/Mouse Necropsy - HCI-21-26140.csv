Additional comments,"mouse appeared normal prior to necropsy, brain was being pushed from a large tumor underneith that was attached to the base of the cranial cavity, possibly from a cranial nerve (right side), a photo was taken. Tumor was very firm and white looking, It was split 3 ways for freezing, cell line, and fixing. I included the tumor along with the brain in the same parafin block.",,
